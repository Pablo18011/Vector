Vector Specs

My Vector draws 22 Amps full throttle 1500 3s lipo and 5amps mid throttle.
Weight 260g no electronics, servo's or motor.
With all electronics and no lipo 410g.
With a 3s 1500mAh = 547g.
Electronics and hardware = 410 - 260 = 150g.

Fuselage Perimeter = 1366.3589mm Area = 19073.3531 mm²

12° throws with servo rate set to 80% and 40% expo.
Still to much movement in elevons pitch will stall, need to reduce
this mechanically my fitting full size control horns.
My FC is set 2.5° from level this lifts the wing to give a higher
angle of attack.This leeds to nose being very high.
Fuse II has a wing incidence of 2.3° (ish) and I have lowered the
nose so it is more even, this should leed to the plane fuse at
near horizontal or maybe 1° higher at the nose?(should fly near level).This may also help at higher speed, but will definitley
need lower throws on servos 6mm maybe?
Also as far as I can tell motor is now 1mm off centre line of aerofoil and motor mount is adjusted to 90° to this line.

Wing Parameters
Wing span = 760mm
Root chord = 215mm
Tip chord = 145mm
Sweep degree = 0

Flying Wing calculator V2
CG calc @20% allround flyer = 36.96mm back leed edge
Wing area = 138550
MAC Distance = 166mm
MAC length = 182.27mm


7 test flights, 1 and 2 crash due to wrong elevon set up(high five test!) 31/5/21 moving CG further back is improving flight characteristics in manual mode.
Still issue with bobbing in manual mode below 6 amps unable to keep nose down, this goes when you pitch up?
2/6/21 Flight 8 result! CG 36mm back balanced 3s lipo take off and flight all in acro, started to get pitch oscillations at 800mAh no voltage sag? usually
when throttle low and below 5 amps?

FC wing mount front 5mm back 4mm.
