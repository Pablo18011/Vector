# Vector
The vector is an FPV RC polypropylene plane I have designed and built from sheets 
of 3 & 4mm fluted polypropylene board (Correx).It’s based on the [Flite Test FT Goblin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Z3un-X16U)

The fuselage is my own design and more streamlined than the original, the wing is made
from one piece and modified from the original.
It’s put together using CA glue apart from fuselage to wing, nose cover, VTX and engine mount
Where I have used hot glue.

The advantages of fluted plastic are increased strength and durability compared to foam board, 
With only a slight increase in weight.The disadvantages, more difficult to cut than foam board and more planning.

# Build

I started with the Flite Test Goblin plans for the wing, I printed these out and used “Spray & Stick” temporary glue to mount the to a piece of 3mm Correx sheet. I cut this out as a one-piece wing.
I modified the spars and assembled the wing with CA glue, similar to the Flite Test build video.
I then designed and built a fuselage out of 3mm Correx. I did some test flights and after many crashes! I worked out the C G for my plane. I then used “Design Spark Mechanical” free CAD software and plotted the build. I then used DSM to improve and refine my build, rebuilding the fuselage. I posted YouTube videos of the build process here.

# Motivation

I have been building and flying FPV quadcopters for a few years now and like many I progressed into RC planes, starting with Flite Test foam board builds.
I wanted to build an FPV wing style plane similar to a [Mini Drak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlEd-lXy8Zg
) and have the crash resilience of a quadcopter! I chose the FT Goblin and fluted polypropylene board as the mixture fitted my requirements. I wasn’t overly concerned about the weight, more the survivability of the plane.
As it turned out, the weight comes in very close to my quads and not that much heavier than the FT Goblin, with the advantage of being a lot stronger and surviving many a poor landing!
It’s also a relatively inexpensive plane to build, Fluted boards are very cheap and like foamboard 
builds, if you break a part, you can just print the plans and build another.
I have also learned a lot of new skills in the process, how to use CAD software being one of them.
