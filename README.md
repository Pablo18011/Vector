# Vector
The vector is an FPV RC polypropylene plane I have designed and built from sheets 
of 3 mm fluted polypropylene board (Correx).It’s based on the Flite Test FT Goblin.

The fuselage is my own design and more streamlined than the original, the wing is made
from one piece and modified from the original.
It’s put together using CA glue apart from fuselage to wing, nose cover, VTX and engine mount
Where I have used hot glue.

The advantages of fluted plastic are increased strength and durability compared to foam board, 
With only a slight increase in weight.The disadvantages, more difficult to cut than foam board and more planning.
